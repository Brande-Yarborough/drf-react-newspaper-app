# drf-react-newspaper-app

Upon opening the app, users are presented with a homepage that displays the latest published news stories from different categories such as business, politics, entertainment, sports, health, and more. The user can then select a category of their interest, and the app will display a list of articles from that particular category.

Upon logging into the app, verified users can create new articles, edit their existing articles that are in the draft phase, and delete articles that have not been submitted for review. Once an article has been submitted for review, it cannot be edited or deleted by the user.

Upon logging in, admin users can access a dashboard that displays a list of submitted articles, which have been created by verified users. Admin users can review the submitted articles and either publish them or reject them. If an article is rejected, the user who submitted it can make the necessary changes and resubmit the article for review. Admin users can also archive published articles, making them no longer visible to the public.

In addition to publishing, rejecting, and archiving articles, admin users can also create and edit articles. The app provides a simple and intuitive article editor that makes it easy for admin users to create and edit articles.
